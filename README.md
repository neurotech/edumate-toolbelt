# :school_satchel: edumate-toolbelt

A collection of tools for working with Edumate on the command line.

---

## TODO

 1. Refactor `student` and `staff` commands to be renamed to `student_number` and `staff_number` accordingly.
 2. Use the now-available `student` and `staff` commands to add support for searching for `student` and `staff` contacts by name/number, i.e.
  ```shell
  $ edumate staff Tim
    Results:
    --------
    | Tim Douglas |
    | Tim Tan     |
  ```
